Okay! Let's break down what LangChain is.\n","\n","**LangChain is a framework designed to make it easier to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs).** Think of it as a toolkit that helps developers connect LLMs to other data sources and tools, enabling them to create more complex and sophisticated AI applications.\n","\n","Here's a more detailed explanation of its key aspects:\n","\n","**Core Concepts:**\n","\n","* **LLM Orchestration:** LangChain's primary focus is on orchestrating and managing interactions with LLMs. It provides tools and abstractions for:\n","    * **Prompt Management:** Building, structuring, and managing prompts that are sent to LLMs. This includes things like templating, variable injection, and chaining prompts together.\n","    * **Model Calls:** Simplifying the process of calling LLMs from different providers (like OpenAI, Google, etc.) with consistent interfaces.\n","    * **Output Parsing:** Helping to structure and interpret the text responses you get back from LLMs.\n","* **Data Connection:** LangChain enables your LLM applications to access and utilize external data sources like:\n","    * **Document Loaders:** Pulling data from various file types (PDFs, text files, web pages, etc.).\n","    * **Vector Stores:** Storing and retrieving embeddings of text, which allows for semantic search and retrieval.\n","    * **APIs:** Connecting to external APIs to gather real-time data or perform actions.\n","* **Tool Integration:** LangChain facilitates the integration of your LLM application with external tools, allowing them to perform actions beyond just generating text. Examples of tools include:\n","    * **Search Engines:** To get up-to-date information.\n","    * **Calculators:** To perform mathematical operations.\n","    * **Databases:** To query and interact with databases.\n","    * **Custom Tools:** You can define your own tools to extend the capabilities of your applications.\n","* **Chains:** LangChain allows you to chain together multiple components, such as LLMs, data sources, and tools, to create complex workflows. This enables you to create multi-step processes.\n","* **Agents:** LangChain provides a way to build agents that can reason about how to use tools and data to accomplish a specific task. Agents can make decisions on their own, rather than just following a predefined sequence of steps.\n","\n","**Why use LangChain?**\n","\n","* **Abstraction & Simplification:** LangChain hides away much of the complexity involved in working with LLMs, making it easier for developers to focus on building their applications.\n","* **Rapid Development:** It provides pre-built components and abstractions that speed up the development process.\n","* **Extensibility:** You can easily extend LangChain with your own custom components and tools.\n","* **Community Support:** LangChain has a large and active community, providing support and resources.\n","\n","**In short, think of LangChain as a bridge between the powerful capabilities of LLMs and the practical needs of developers building real-world applications. It helps you go beyond simple text generation and create more intelligent, interactive, and useful AI systems.**\n","\n","**Examples of Applications Built with LangChain:**\n","\n","* **Chatbots:** More sophisticated chatbots that can access external knowledge and tools.\n","* **Question Answering Systems:** Systems that can answer complex questions by accessing various data sources.\n","* **Document Summarization:** Tools that can condense large documents into concise summaries.\n","* **Code Generation:** Tools that can generate code based on natural language instructions.\n","* **Personal Assistants:** AI assistants that can perform tasks and interact with various services.\n","\n","Let me know if you have any more questions or want to dive deeper into any specific aspect of LangChain!\n","\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import userdata\n","from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAI\n","from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n","from langchain.chains import LLMChain\n","GEMINI_API_KEY = userdata.get('GEMINI_API_KEY')\n","\n","# Configure the Gemini Flash model\n","llm = GoogleGenerativeAI(\n","    api_key= GEMINI_API_KEY,\n","    model=\"gemini-2.0-flash-exp\",\n","    temperature=0.7  # Adjust for creativity\n",")\n","\n","# Create a prompt template\n","prompt_template = PromptTemplate(\n","    input_variables=[\"question\"],\n","    template=\"You are a helpful assistant.
